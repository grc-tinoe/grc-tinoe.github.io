        <p> My name is Tim Noe, and I'm a first year in Graphic Communication at Cal Poly. I'm currently living in Santa Maria, California working as a flex supervisor at UPS. As a flex supervisor, I answer customer phone calls, dispatch drivers, and help with warehouse operations. In the future, I'm interested in a career in digital marketing or being a financial advisor. </p>
